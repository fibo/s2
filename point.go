// The Riemann Sphere (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_sphere)
// extends the complex plane by adding one point at Infinity.
// Actually is the plane plus one point, say it the North pole,
// with some good math formulas to ensure nice behaviuors, in
// particular to avoid functions discontinuity and other goodies like
// conformal map (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformal_map) i.e.
// circles are mapped into circles.
// I dedicate this work to my father Umberto Casati and the great
// mathematician Luigi Bianchi who was a great inspiration for me.
